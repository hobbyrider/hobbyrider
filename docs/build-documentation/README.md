## 🚀 Quick Start

**For navigation:** Start with [`00-INDEX.md`](00-INDEX.md) - it has links to all sections

**For a complete overview:** The original file was split due to Git size limits. Use the numbered files above.

**For specific topics:** Navigate directly to the numbered split files (01-09)

**For quick reference:** See `09-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (when created)

## 📍 Location

All build documentation is now centralized in:
```
docs/build-documentation/
```

This makes it easy to find all build-related documentation in one place.
