## Files Kept in Root

**Active Documentation**:

## Current Structure

### Root Directory
- Clean and organized with only essential files
- 5 markdown files (down from 25+)

### docs/ Directory
- Well-organized documentation
- 18+ documentation files organized by topic
- New README.md index for easy navigation

### .archive/ Directory
- Temporary documentation for reference
- Test routes for development/debugging
- Historical reports and analysis

## Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation** - Root directory is cleaner and easier to scan
2. **Better Organization** - Documentation is properly categorized
3. **Reduced Clutter** - Unused files archived but accessible
4. **Preserved History** - All files kept for reference
5. **Clear Structure** - Easy to find active vs archived files

## Notes

- All archived files are preserved and can be restored if needed
- Build remains successful after cleanup
- No active functionality was removed
- Test routes can be restored for debugging if needed
