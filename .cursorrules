# Cursor Rules for hobbyrider

## Typography Rules (CRITICAL)

**Typography styles must only come from typography components.**
- Direct Tailwind typography utilities (text-*, leading-*, tracking-*, font-*) are FORBIDDEN outside of `components/typography.tsx`.
- Always use components from `app/components/typography.tsx`:
  - `<PageTitle>` for h1
  - `<SectionTitle>` for h2
  - `<CardTitle>` for h3
  - `<SmallHeading>` for h4
  - `<Text>` for body text
  - `<Muted>` for muted paragraphs
  - `<Small>` for small text
  - `<Caption>` for fine print/footer disclaimers
  - `<NavLinkText>`, `<ButtonText>`, `<LabelText>` for specific UI elements

## Font Family

- Only Inter font is used. Set in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Do not mix fonts or add additional font families.

## Mobile Responsiveness (CRITICAL)

**All new development MUST be mobile-responsive from the start.**
- Every new page, component, and feature must work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use Tailwind responsive breakpoints consistently:
  - Mobile-first: Base styles for mobile (< 640px)
  - `sm:` prefix for tablet/desktop (640px+)
  - `lg:` prefix for large desktop (1024px+)
- Common responsive patterns to follow:
  - Padding: `px-4 sm:px-6`, `py-6 sm:py-10`
  - Text sizes: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl`, `text-sm sm:text-base`
  - Images: `h-16 w-16 sm:h-24 sm:w-24`
  - Grids: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
  - Spacing: `gap-2 sm:gap-4`, `space-y-4 sm:space-y-6`
  - Flex direction: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
- Always test layouts on mobile viewport (320px - 640px width).
- Buttons and interactive elements must have adequate touch targets (min 44x44px).
- Forms and inputs must be easily usable on mobile devices.
- Navigation and menus must be mobile-friendly (consider hamburger menus for complex nav).

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use `cn()` utility from `lib/cn.ts` for className merging

## Design System Protection (CRITICAL)

**The global design system is PROTECTED and must NOT be modified unless explicitly requested.**

### Protected Files - DO NOT MODIFY:
- `app/globals.css` - Contains all design tokens, CSS variables, and global styles
  - **NEVER** modify this file unless:
    - User explicitly requests a design system upgrade
    - Fixing a critical bug that breaks the design system
    - User explicitly approves the change
- `app/components/typography.tsx` - Typography components (only modify to add new components or fix bugs)
- `components/ui/*.tsx` - shadcn/ui components (button, badge, input, etc.)
  - **NEVER** modify these files unless:
    - User explicitly requests changes to shadcn components
    - Fixing critical bugs
    - User explicitly approves the change

### Rules for Feature Development:
- **DO**: Use existing typography components, design tokens (CSS variables), and existing patterns
- **DON'T**: 
  - Modify `app/globals.css` without explicit permission
  - Add global CSS rules that affect the entire application
  - Override design tokens
  - Use `prose` classes or similar that add default styles (bullet points, blue links, etc.)
  - Add global link styles (no-underline, color changes)
  - Add global list styles (list-style, padding, margin)

### When Adding New Features:
- Use scoped Tailwind classes for component-specific styling
- Use design tokens (CSS variables) for colors and spacing
- Follow existing component patterns in the codebase
- Test that your changes don't affect other pages/components

### Design System Changes:
- Only modify the design system when explicitly requested by the user
- Document any design system changes
- Test thoroughly across all pages before deployment

See `docs/architecture/DESIGN_SYSTEM_PROTECTION.md` for full details.
See `docs/architecture/SHADCN_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for shadcn/ui component configuration.
